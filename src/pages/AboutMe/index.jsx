        I have been designing and developing websites professionally for almost
        a decade. My career began as a Senior Web Developer for Hearst Media
        Services, where I learned the ins-and-outs of working alone and with
        teams in a professional atmosphere.

        I later went on to create modernthemes.net – a WordPress theme company
        that offers both free and premium themes. Our themes have been
        downloaded millions of times and currently power over 50,000 active
        websites. Featured on the likes of WP Tavern and Web Designer Depot, we
        even have themes available on the WordPress.org theme repository.

        I’ve most recently worked as a full-time freelancer for Estée Lauder
        Online in New York City where I managed and maintained their Bumble and
        bumble brand’s website for nearly three years and helped facilitate
        their transition from outdated and hardcoded web practices to usage of a
        streamlined Drupal CMS platform. I often contributed as a designer as
        well, working in-house at their Meatpacking District location.
