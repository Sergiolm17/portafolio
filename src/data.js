  `My name is Rob Grabowski and I’m a web designer and developer.`,
  `
    I have been designing and developing websites professionally for almost
    a decade. My career began as a Senior Web Developer for Hearst Media
    Services, where I learned the ins-and-outs of working alone and with
    teams in a professional atmosphere.`,
  `I later went on to create modernthemes.net – a WordPress theme company
    that offers both free and premium themes. Our themes have been
    downloaded millions of times and currently power over 50,000 active
    websites. Featured on the likes of WP Tavern and Web Designer Depot, we
    even have themes available on the WordPress.org theme repository.
    `,
  `
    I’ve most recently worked as a full-time freelancer for Estée Lauder
    Online in New York City where I managed and maintained their Bumble and
    bumble brand’s website for nearly three years and helped facilitate
    their transition from outdated and hardcoded web practices to usage of a
    streamlined Drupal CMS platform. I often contributed as a designer as
    well, working in-house at their Meatpacking District location.
